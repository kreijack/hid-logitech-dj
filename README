This is a beta for a driver for the Logitech mouse M560/M545/M546; this mouse is
designed for Windows 8, and has a non conventional behavior: the mouse
appears as a pair of mouse and keyboard and some buttons
don't emit the standard mouse button event, but instead a combination
of keyboard and mouse button. This prevent a "confortable" use of
this mouse under Linux.

This driver allow to use this mouse like an ordinary mouse. The driver is
based on the source of hid-logitech-hidpp.c Linux driver.
